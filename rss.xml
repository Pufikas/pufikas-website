            <title>Do you use vim/nvim as your main IDE?</title>
            <description>Added blog section, so you can view all my posts! And recently I picked up learning nvim and I aim to use it as my main IDE (leaving from vscodium). Shortcuts are very powerful in vim, but pretty hard to remember or get used to it.</description>
